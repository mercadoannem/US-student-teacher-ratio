Student-Teacher Ratio Map Explorer

Overview
This project visualizes public school student-teacher ratios (STR) across the United States at the county level. 
The interactive map allows users to explore STR data by selecting U.S. states and zooming into individual counties. 
It aims to support data-driven discussions around educational resource allocation and accessibility.

**Note: Current data points are only for Erie County, NY. Data for other counties will be added for the final project.**

Purpose
The map was created to help identify regions with disproportionately high student-teacher ratios, enabling educators, policymakers, and the public to better understand where educational support may be most needed.
